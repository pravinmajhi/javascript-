as we know that in if statement 
if the statementis true it used to be print
and if false it used to be pass/out the statement

but on  IF ELSE statement the other statement will be printed 
inshort anyhow the will be statement print 

how to write the statement in javascript:

if (condition true){
    statement for true
}else {
    statement for false
}

example:
var x = 15;
if (x > 30){
    document.write("X is greater ")
    //as it is a false statement it won't print
}else{
    document.write("X is smaller");
    // this will print because upper statement was false
}
